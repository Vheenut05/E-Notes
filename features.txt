Log in or Sign up:

This feature involves user authentication. You may want to prioritize it as the first step since other features, such as uploading performances and generating musical sheets, may require user accounts.
Upload or Record Band Performance:

After implementing user authentication, focus on providing users with the ability to upload audio files or record performances within the app. This is a core functionality for your application.
Recognize Instruments Used:

Once users can upload or record performances, implement the instrument recognition algorithm. This feature relies on the availability of uploaded performances.
Generate Musical Sheets:

With instrument recognition in place, work on creating the algorithm to convert recognized notes and instruments into musical sheets. This is a central feature of your application.
User Feedback and Help:

Integrate a feedback system to improve instrument recognition accuracy. Consider adding in-app help or tutorials to guide users through the process. This can be implemented concurrently with other features.
User Profile:

Allow users to customize their profiles, add details about their musical preferences, and track their uploaded performances. This can be implemented after the core features are in place.
Social Integration:

Implement sharing features to allow users to showcase their performances on social media platforms. Consider integrating a commenting or liking system for community engagement. This can be implemented once the core functionality is stable.
Responsive Design:

Ensure that your app is mobile-friendly and has a responsive design for a seamless experience on various devices. This is an ongoing consideration throughout development but can be fine-tuned toward the end.
